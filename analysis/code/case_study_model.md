# Analysis of model predicting TD by Area, Kd, and Julian day
# Analysis of the collinearity of the predictors in the survey model used in the GTH 91 case study

These analyses are for the revisions to the boondoggle manuscript for Inland Waters and are based on the comment by Reviewer D:

> They state that thermocline depth in GTH 91 was predicted from the relationship between thermocline depth, Kd, surface area, and Julian day established in the surveys.  In the first section (Lake surveys) the authors note that Kd was significantly related to lake surface area and Julian day. Is there not an issue with collinearly if both Kd, surface area and Julian day are then used as independent variables in a regression? Indeed, there is no mention here that any of the assumptions of linear regression were assessed.

In "model_colinearity_analysis.R" I assess the collinearity of the predictors and determine that Kd and Area and Kd and Julian Day are slightly collinear (r^2^ = 0.1 and 0.2 resp.)

In this analysis I am assessing the effect of removing the correlated predictors from the model of GTH 91

## Conclusions

Despite the collinearity between Kd, Area, and Julian Day, the inclusion of all of them in the model is the best way to predict TD in GTH 91.

The slope of the actual relationship is 0.87

Using Kd alone provides a poor prediction of the TD in GTH 91

Using Kd + Julian Day does a decent job (R^2^ = 0.82) but underestimates the slope which is 0.78 and does not correct the bias in depth

Removing the large outlying lakes does not improve the slope fit slope = 0.78 and increases the depth bias

The whole model used in the original analysis does the best job of reproducing the slope in the original data.

There is further justification for using all of the predictor variables.  There is independent information that lake area and time since stratification will affect TD.
