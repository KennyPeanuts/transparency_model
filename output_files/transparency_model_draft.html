<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Substantial work has been done on the effects of climate change on lakes (Tranvik et al. 2009), yet significant questions remain regarding the effect of climate change on sediment processes. Sediment organic matter burial efficiency is the imbalance between organic matter inputs and losses (Capone and Kiene 1988, Canfield 1994, Burdige 2007) and represents a potentially important sink for atmospheric carbon [@CITE]. Inputs of organic matter to lake sediments derive from primary production in the water column, surface sediment, and watershed but the loss of sediment organic matter is largely a sediment process and depends on the factors limiting organic matter mineralization within the sediments (Capone and Kiene 1988, Canfield 1994, Burdige 2007, Sobek et al. 2009).</p>
<p>The rate of sediment organic matter mineralization is affected by temperature, the availability of oxygen (Hargrave 1969, Graneli 1978, Archer and Devol 1992, Sobek et al. 2009), and the availability of labile organic matter (Sweerts et al 1986, Sugai and Kipphut 1992, Kristensen 2000, Dedieu et al. 2007). Alteration to lake environmental conditions or organic matter inputs that result from climate change can therefore have indirect effects on the burial efficiency of organic matter in lake sediments, and change the role of lakes in regional carbon cycling.</p>
<p>Recently Gudasz et al. (2010) estimated that predicted warming will result in a 6–15% decrease in organic matter burial in boreal lakes due to the increase in surface water temperature and its direct effect on sediment organic matter mineralization. Supporting this conclusion, Flanagan and McCauley (2010) produced a 2-fold increase in pCO<sub>2</sub> by experimentally warming mesocosms within a shallow lake. However, these findings do not take into account the effects of the full suite of potential changes to lake environmental conditions due to climate change, specifically alterations to the distribution of temperature and oxygen in stratified lakes. Fortino et al. (2013) has shown that the thermocline depth of lakes in the Alaskan Arctic is inversely proportional to the transparency of the lake. Furthermore, the sediment organic matter mineralization rate of lakes in the same region is proportional to the availability of temperature and oxygen and not greatly affected by the source or quality of the sediments (Fortino et al. 2013). These conditions suggest that there is an indirect effect of lake transparency on organic matter burial efficiency in these lakes. Epilimnetic sediments are exposed to conditions that should increase mineralization (warm and oxygenated), while hypolimnetic sediments are exposed to conditions that should limit mineralization (cold and hypoxic). As a result, whole-lake sediment organic matter mineralization (and burial efficiency) should be sensitive to changes in the stratification depth as well as temperature.</p>
<p>The transparency of the lakes is primarily determined but the attenuation of light by particulate organic matter (including algal cells) and dissolved organic matter (DOM), which often measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOC; Wetzel 2001). Many of the world's surface waters are becoming less transparent as a result of increased inputs of DOC from the watershed and recovery from acidification (Forsberg 1992, Gunn et al. 2001, Arvola et al. 2010). Evans et al. (2006) show that the DOC concentration of lakes in the United Kingdom has increased by 63% between the periods of 1988–1993 and 1998–2003. Similarly, Skjelkvale et al. (2005) found that the DOC concentrations of a large number of surface waters in North America and Europe have increased 0.05 to 0.13 mg L-1 y-1 for the past 11 years. In both cases it appears that part of this change in DOC concentration was due to reduced SO4 deposition and the subsequent reduction in DOC flocculation as the lakes recovered from acidification. As a result, the magnitude of the increases may level off in the future. However some of the increase also appears to be due to the effects of warming and elevated DOC release from soils (Keller et al. 2008), which means that the concentrations could continue to increase in the future (Skjelkvale et al. 2005). Dissolved organic carbon release from high latitude soils may increase up to 600% in response to warming especially in regions with extensive permafrost (Frey and Smith 2005). Neff and Hooper (2002) found a 2 to 3 fold increase in DOC export from Alaskan Arctic soils experimentally warmed to 30o C. The predominant trend in response to climate changes in the northern hemisphere seems to be an increase in DOC export from the watershed and thus a decrease in lake transparency (Skjelkvale et al. 2005). However some regions may see a reduction in DOC input into lakes and increases in lake transparency as a result of reduced precipitation (Schindler et al. 1996, Schindler 1997).</p>
<p>The changes in lake transparency that result from altered DOM inputs to lakes may subsequently drive changes in sediment organic matter storage by altering the environmental conditions of the lake sediments. In this paper we use published results on the effect of light attenuation on thermocline depth and the effect of temperature and oxygen availability on SOD to model the sensitivity of whole–lake SOD to changes in lake transparency and temperature in a well-studied Alaskan Arctic lake. We hypothesize that a net increase in DOM transport from the watershed to lakes will result in decreased thermocline depth during the ice-free season and reduce the area of sediments exposed to warm oxygenated waters. The net effect of these changes will be an overall decrease in organic matter mineralization in lakes, which will not be fully compensated for by epilimnetic warming.</p>

<p>To evaluate how changes in Kd might affect sediment organic matter mineralization through changes in thermocline depth, we modeled the relevant interactions in Lake GTH 91 under 3 cases: 1. current conditions, 2. warming only, and 3. warming plus increased Kd. We chose to model these relationships in lake GTH 91 because we had collected SOD, bathymetric, and environmental data on the lake, and thus we could reasonably approximate the stratification dynamics. Current conditions in lake GTH 91 were estimated from temperature, irradiance and dissolved oxygen measurements collected as described above on 8 dates in 2006 and 5 dates in 2008 (Table 5). The warming only scenario evaluated a 1o C and a 6o C increase in epilimnetic temperature to approximate the 1.1o to 6.4o C increase in temperature that is considered “likely” by the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; Gudasz et al. 2010).<br />The exact changes to lake transparency that may result from climate change in the Arctic and elsewhere are difficult to predict, however Keller et al. (2008) estimate a 0.5 to 2.3 mg L-1 increase in lake DOC concentration per 1o C temperature increase based on a long–term study of 12 lakes over a relatively large spatial area. To conservatively estimate the changes in lake transparency following “likely” warming we modeled a 0.5 mg L-1 increase in lake DOC concentration per 1o C temperature increase (Keller et al. 2008) to produce a range of possible changes in lake GTH 91 DOC concentrations following 0o, 1o, or 6o C warming. We then used the used the relationship between DOC concentration and Kd identified in the 2008 survey and a measurement of the DOC concentration of lake GTH 91 in early July 2009 to calculate the Kd values associated with the changes in DOC concentration following 0o, 1o, or 6o C warming. To evaluate how changes in transparency and stratification depth would affect the environmental conditions of the lake sediments, we calculated the sediment area above and below the thermocline using the relationship from Livingstone and Imboden (1996): M=A-(A(1-□(Z_TD/Z_max ))^∝) Where: M = the sediment area above the thermocline (ha). A = the surface area of the lake (ha). ZTD = the thermocline depth (m). Zmax = the maximum depth of the lake (m). α = a non–dimensional exponent determined graphically from the hypsographic curve. The hypsographic curve of the lake was generated from a bathymetric map created by combining a lake perimeter measurement determined with a Tremble Geo Explorer with sonar transects collected with a Garmin GPSMAP 180. The lake bottom profile was extrapolated from the sonar measurements using a triangulated irregular network to convert the observed depths into 1 m contour lines in ARC-GIS (ESRI 2006). Surface areas and volumes of each depth interval were calculated using the 1 m contour intervals. To estimate the sediment area above the thermocline with different Kd values we substituted a linear model of the relationship between thermocline depth, Kd, surface area, and Julian day derived from the lake surveys for thermocline depth (ZTD) in equation 1: M=A-(A(1-□((β_(1 ) K_d+β_2 〖A+β〗<em>(3 ) J+β</em>(0 ))/Z_max ))^α)</p>
<p>Where: βn = the slope of the multiple regression model for the nth term. β0 is the y–intercept of the multiple regression model. Kd = the light attenuation coefficient (m-1). J = the Julian day.</p>
<p>This linear model is derived from a multiple regression of the effect of Kd, lake surface area, and the Julian day, without interaction on thermocline depth from the lake surveys. This model partially violates the assumptions of linear models because the Kd was moderately collinear with lake surface area and Julian day in the surveys (see results), however we elect to include these terms because the collinearity was not severe (see results) and lake surface area (Gorham and Boyce 1989) and time since stratification (i.e., Julian day; Blanton 1973, Wetzel 2001) have been shown to be significant factors affecting thermocline depth in addition to transparency. The effect of transparency on stratification depth was estimated with the above model using the Kd values calculated from the DOC concentrations estimated in lake GTH 91 under 0o, 1o, or 6o C warming. The Kd value from the 6o C warming scenario produced a negative sediment area above the thermocline for the first date of the dataset. This negative value was assumed to be 0 for the calculations of whole-lake SOD. We do not have in-situ measurements of gross SOD from above and below the thermocline of lake GTH 91 during the summers of 2006 and 2008, so we estimated the whole-lake SOD using the relationship between SOD, temperature and oxygen concentration from the incubation experiments. The whole-lake SOD was calculated as the sum of the SOD above and below the thermocline, which was calculated from an estimated areal SOD rate times the relevant sediment area. The areal SOD above the thermocline was estimated as the median of the SOD measured at 12o C in the temperature dependence experiment. The areal SOD below the thermocline was estimated by adjusting the median areal SOD above the thermocline by the slope of the relationship between temperature and SOD and oxygen concentration and SOD from the temperature and oxygen availability experiments, respectively. The temperature and oxygen conditions above and below the thermocline were estimated from the temperature and oxygen profiles collected repeatedly in GTH 91 during the summers of 2006 and 2008. To evaluate how the three modeled scenarios would alter whole-lake SOD, we calculated whole-lake SOD using the epilimnetic temperature and sediment areas above and below the thermocline for a 0o, 1o, or 6o C warming with and without a change in DOC and transparency.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Thermocline depth ranged between 2.0 and 5.5 m when lake GTH 91 was sampled in 2006 and 2008 (Table 5). Over the same time period, Kd ranged from 0.56 to 1.04 m-1. Regression of the actual thermocline depths against Julian day explained 92% of the variation in the data and showed a 0.09 m d-1 increase in thermocline depth with time (Fig. 8). The DOC concentration of lake GTH 91 in early July 2009, was 5.5 mg L-1 (SCW, unpub. data), which produces an estimated Kd value of 1.04 m-1. Estimation of the change in thermocline depth by Julian day using the modeled Kd value shows a 0.07 m d-1 increase in thermocline depth with time and a 40% reduction in the initial thermocline depth (Fig. 8). During the period sampled, the actual percent sediment area above the thermocline estimated from equation 1 varied from 10.6 to 32.9%. Using the Kd of lake GTH 91 estimated from the DOC concentration, the model (eq. 2) estimates that percent sediment area above the thermocline would vary between 6.2 and 23.0% over the same time period as the study.</p>
<p>The median temperature of the epilimnion of GTH 91 during 2006 and 2008 was 12.9o C. We estimated the areal SOD of the epilimnion of GTH 91 as 18.6 mmol O2 m-2 d-1, which is the median SOD of the sediments from GTH 91 at 12o C from temperature dependence experiment. The temperature and oxygen profiles collected in GTH 91 show that the water temperature below the thermocline was approximately 4.5o C and the median oxygen deficit was 59% of surface O2 (Table 5). Using these temperature and oxygen conditions, the estimated areal SOD rate below the thermocline declines to 8.2 mmol O2 m-2 d-1. Using these estimates of the SOD above and below the thermocline, the model based on no warming or change in transparency shows a summertime range of whole-lake SOD from 221 to 264 mol O2 d-1 with a median of 247 mol O2 d-1 (Fig. 9). Assuming a 1o C increase in temperature above the thermocline with no change in thermocline depth, the model shows a 1% increase in median whole-lake SOD (Fig. 9). Assuming a 6o C increase in temperature above the thermocline with no change in thermocline depth, the model predicts a 5.9% increase in whole-lake SOD (Fig. 9).</p>
<p>The DOC concentration of lake GTH 91 in early July 2009 was 5.5 mg L-1 (SCW, unpub. data), so a 0.5 mg L-1 increase in lake DOC concentration per 1o C temperature increase would result in a DOC concentration of 6.0 and 8.5 mg L-1 following a 1o and 6o C increase in temperature, respectively. We estimate that these increases in the DOC concentration would increase the Kd value of the lake to 1.1 and 1.5 m-1, respectively. Out model predicts that this change in transparency would result in a range of 5 to 22% sediment area above the thermocline for a 1o C temperature increase and a range of 0 to 15% sediment above the thermocline for a 6o C increase in temperature over the same time period as the study.</p>
<p>Based on these results, the net effect of warming and a change in transparency and thermocline depth would be a reduction in the whole-lake SOD due to the reduction in sediment area above the thermocline. The model output including a change in lake transparency showed a 0.5% reduction in whole lake SOD following a 1o C increase in temperature and a 5% decrease in whole-lake SOD following a 6o C increase in temperature (Fig. 9).</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The results of the lake surveys indicate the lake transparency is an important factor affecting the thermocline depth in these arctic lakes. Furthermore, the sediment incubation experiments show that sediment organic matter mineralization rate is affected by the temperature and oxygen concentration of the water overlying the sediments. The combination of these results suggests that changes in lake transparency may alter whole-lake organic matter mineralization indirectly by changing the distribution of temperature and oxygen in the lake through changes in thermocline depth. We used Lake GTH 91 as a case study to evaluate how sensitive whole-lake SOD would be to a change in temperature and transparency consistent with possible future climate scenarios.</p>
<p>The regression model predicting the changes in thermocline depth with time in lake GTH 91 skews the initial thermocline depth shallower and shows a more gradual increase in thermocline depth with time than was observed during the summers of 2006 and 2008. The reduced slope of the modeled thermocline depth with time is likely due to the use of a constant Kd value through time when the observed data shows an overall reduction in the Kd value of the lake with time. Despite these differences the model produces what appears to be realistic variation in thermocline depth and thus is suitable to assess the sensitivity of whole-lake SOD to changes in thermocline depth. Both the observed and modeled data show that as the thermocline depth increases throughout the summer the sediment area above the thermocline increases. Since the water above the thermocline was warmer and more oxygenated than the water below the thermocline, thermocline depth is a major factor determining the temperature and oxygen availability of the sediments in both the observed and modeled conditions. Gudasz et al. (2010) hypothesize that a predicted 1.8 to 4o C increase in temperature would increase sediment organic matter mineralization rates and decrease sediment organic matter burial efficiency in lakes. Consistent with these findings, the results of the sediment incubations estimate that a 1o and 6o C increase in epilimnetic temperature would increase the SOD (and by inference organic matter mineralization) of the sediments above the thermocline in lake GTH 91 which would result in a 1% to 6% increase in whole lake sediment organic matter mineralization. However this estimate does not consider the effect of changes to thermocline depth that would result from changes in lake transparency.</p>
<p>Incorporating a decrease in lake transparency into the estimate of sediment respiration in lake GTH 91 following a 1o to 6o C warming shows a 0.5% to 5% decrease in whole–lake SOD despite the increase in SOD above the thermocline. We recognize that this assessment of the combined effects of temperature and transparency on whole-lake SOD relies on extrapolation from limited data, however the case study shows that whole-lake SOD is sensitive to fairly modest changes in thermocline depth and predicts that the net effect of warming and a decrease in lake transparency is a reduction in the mineralization of sediment organic matter in the lake.</p>
