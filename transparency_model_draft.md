Abstract
The burial of organic matter within lake sediments can be a significant component of landscape carbon cycling. Whether organic matter deposited in lake sediments is sequestered or mineralized depends on factors limiting the decomposition rate of organic matter, such as temperature and the availability of oxygen. In stratified lakes, the distribution of temperature and oxygen is determined by the depth of the thermocline and therefore sediment organic matter burial should be sensitive to changes in thermocline depth. Using a survey of more than 30 lakes over 3 years in the Alaskan Arctic, we found that thermocline depth during the summer was positively correlated with water transparency.  Furthermore using sediment incubations from 3 lakes, we show that sediment oxygen demand is affected primarily by temperature and the availability of oxygen with limited effect of the source of the sediments.  To assess the sensitivity of whole-lake sediment oxygen demand to changes in epilimnetic temperature and transparency mediated changes in thermocline depth, we modeled the effects of a 1o and 6 o C warming of the epilimnion alone and a 1o and 6 o C epilimnetic warming simultaneous with a decline in epilimnetic transparency in a well-studied arctic lake. Warming alone increase whole-lake sediment oxygen demand but warming with a simultaneous reduction in transparency resulted in a decrease in whole-lake sediment oxygen demand due to the reduction in thermocline depth and the sediment area above the thermocline.

Introduction
Lakes are an integral part of the global carbon cycle (Cole et al. 2007, Tranvik et al 2009). Nearly all of the world's lakes export CO2 to the atmosphere and these emissions account for approximately 15% of the annual CO2 production from freshwater systems (lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, and groundwater; Cole et al. 2007). However, lakes are simultaneously a sink for organic carbon via burial in their sediments (Cole et al. 2007, Sobek et al 2009). Organic matter sequestration in lake sediments is estimated to represent 22% of burial in all freshwater systems, which itself represents 30 to 60% of the organic carbon stored in marine sediments per year (Cole et al. 2007). 
Sediment organic matter burial efficiency is the imbalance between organic matter inputs and losses (Capone and Kiene 1988, Canfield 1994, Burdige 2007). Inputs of organic matter to the sediments derive from primary production in the water column, surface sediment, and watershed but the loss of sediment organic matter is largely a sediment process and depends on the factors limiting organic matter mineralization within the sediments (Capone and Kiene 1988, Canfield 1994, Burdige 2007, Sobek et al. 2009). 
Temperature, the availability of oxygen (Hargrave 1969, Graneli 1978, Archer and Devol 1992, Sobek et al. 2009), and the availability of labile organic matter (Sweerts et al 1986, Sugai and Kipphut 1992, Kristensen 2000, Dedieu et al. 2007) have all been shown to alter the rate of sediment respiration (and by inference organic matter mineralization). Therefore variation in lake environmental conditions or organic matter inputs may alter the burial efficiency of organic matter in lake sediments and change their relationship with carbon cycling at the landscape scale.   
In lakes that thermally stratify, the depth of the thermocline is the principal factor controlling the distribution of temperature and oxygen in the water overlying the sediments (Wetzel 2001). Sediments above the thermocline are exposed to relatively warm and oxygenated conditions and should have proportionally greater organic matter mineralization rates. Below the thermocline the sediments are exposed to relatively cold temperatures and are isolated from inputs of atmospheric oxygen, which should result in proportionally lower organic matter mineralization rates. As a result, whole-lake sediment organic matter mineralization (and burial efficiency) should be sensitive to changes in the stratification depth. 
A principal factor affecting the stratification depth of a lake is the attenuation of radiant energy by dissolved organic matter (DOM, often estimated from dissolved organic carbon, DOC) in the lake water (Fee et al. 1996, Houser 2006, Caplanne and Laurion 2008).  Many of the world's surface waters are becoming less transparent as a result of increased inputs of DOC from the watershed and recovery from acidification (Forsberg 1992, Gunn et al. 2001, Arvola et al. 2010). 
Evans et al. (2006) show that the DOC concentration of lakes in the United Kingdom has increased by 63% between the periods of 1988–1993 and 1998–2003. Similarly, Skjelkvale et al. (2005) found that the DOC concentrations of a large number of surface waters in North America and Europe have increased 0.05 to 0.13 mg L-1 y-1 for the past 11 years. In both cases it appears that part of this change in DOC concentration was due to reduced SO4 deposition and the subsequent reduction in DOC flocculation as the lakes recovered from acidification.  As a result, the magnitude of the increases may level off in the future. However some of the increase also appears to be due to the effects of warming and elevated DOC release from soils (Keller et al. 2008), which means that the concentrations could continue to increase in the future (Skjelkvale et al. 2005). Dissolved organic carbon release from high latitude soils may increase up to 600% in response to warming especially in regions with extensive permafrost (Frey and Smith 2005). Neff and Hooper (2002) found a 2 to 3 fold increase in DOC export from Alaskan Arctic soils experimentally warmed to 30o C. The predominant trend in response to climate changes in the northern hemisphere seems to be an increase in DOC export from the watershed and thus a decrease in lake transparency (Skjelkvale et al. 2005). However some regions may see a reduction in DOC input into lakes and increases in lake transparency as a result of reduced precipitation (Schindler et al. 1996, Schindler 1997).
If there is a relationship between stratification depth and sediment metabolic processes, then changes in DOM inputs to lakes may indirectly affect sediment organic matter processing by altering the distribution of temperature and oxygen via changes in lake transparency and stratification depth. In this paper we demonstrate a relationship between lake transparency and stratification depth during the summer, open-water period in arctic Alaskan lakes.  Furthermore, we provide evidence that temperature and oxygen availability are principle factors affecting the rate of sediment organic matter mineralization in these Arctic lakes.  To test the sensitivity of whole-lake sediment oxygen demand, we apply these relationships to well-studied Arctic lake and model how epilimnetic warming and a reduction in lake transparency would affect whole-lake sediment organic matter mineralization. 
  Materials and Methods
Study Site
This study was conducted in the Arctic Foothills region of Alaska. This region of the Arctic is underlain by continuous permafrost with predominantly tundra vegetation (Ping et al. 1998). The annual mean temperature is between -10o and -8o C with low annual precipitation (140 to 270 mm), of which 40% is snow (Ping et al. 1998). During the summer, the region experiences 24-h daylight and average temperatures of 11o C (Oechel et al. 2000). The numerous lakes in the region are typically oligotrophic, relatively small and shallow (Levine and Whalen 2001), and are ice-covered for approximately 9 months.  The mean (± 1 standard deviation) percent organic matter of the surface sediments (0 – 1 cm) of lakes in the region ranges is 47.5% (± 16.6%) for the sediments above the thermocline and 40.6% (± 9.7%) for sediments below the thermocline, and dry bulk density ranges between 0.008 g cm-3 to 0.416 g cm-3 (Fortino 2010).    
Lake Surveys
On 7 August, 2006, we sampled a total of 18 lakes in the region to the east of Toolik Lake (Fig. 1). At each lake, temperature and light (photosynthetic photon flux density; PPFD) profiles were collected using a YSI Model 85 multiparameter water quality meter and a LiCor LI-192SA underwater 2π quantum sensor with a Li-Cor LI-250 Quantum Meter respectively. In some lakes the profiles for both temperature and PPFD were collected with a Hydrolab, Data Sonde 5. Light and temperature measurements were collected at 0.5 m intervals from the water surface to the lake bottom or to a point where the lake reached a constant hypolimnetic temperature with increasing depth. The thermocline depth was defined as the depth with the greatest change in temperature from the preceding depth. The light attenuation coefficient (Kd) in the lake was determined as the slope of the natural log of the PPFD with depth. 
A second survey was conducted on 7 August, 2007. Twelve lakes were sampled to the north of the Toolik Lake field station (Fig. 1). Temperature and light profiles were collected and analyzed using the same methods as in 2006. Surface water samples for DOC concentration were collected in 20 ml borosilicate glass scintillation vials. Each sample was filtered through a 0.45 μm polypropylene (PP) filter, acidified with 500 μl of 1N HCl and stored at 4o C until analyzed for DOC on a Shimadzu TOC-V Total Carbon Analyzer. 
The final survey was conducted on 12 July, 2008. We resampled 15 of the same lakes that were sampled in 2006. Temperature and light profiles were collected using the same methods as in 2006 and 2007. A 1 L sample of surface water was collected from each lake in an amber high density polyethylene sample bottle from which, 2 duplicate 20 ml sub-samples were filtered through a 0.45 μm PP filter and analyzed for chromophoric dissolved organic matter (cDOM) using a Turner Designs 10-AU fluorometer (Clark et al. 2004). Following the cDOM measurement, the samples were acidified with 100 μl of 1 N HCl and analyzed on a Shimadzu TOC-V Total Carbon Analyzer for DOC. The remaining 960 ml of sample were used to determine chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration. Chl a concentration was measured fluorometrically (Turner Designs Model TD-700 Fluorometer) from duplicate samples of filter-trapped (Whatman GF/F) particulate matter extracted for 24 h in a buffered 90% acetone solution (Welchmeyer 1994). 
Lake areas and maximum depths were determined as part of a group sampling effort and lake watershed areas were calculated using a digital elevation model and the hydrology toolset in ArcMap GIS software (ESRI 2006). 
Sediment Incubations
The effect of temperature and oxygen availability on sediment organic matter mineralization was determined by measuring sediment oxygen demand (SOD) from intact sediment core incubations in 3 lakes. Lakes E–4, S–3, and GTH 91 are oligotrophic lakes in the vicinity of Toolik Lake with surface areas of 4.0, 4.2, and 2.5 ha, and depths of 4, 5, and 10 m, respectively (Fig. 2). The percent organic matter of the surface sediments (0 – 1cm) above the thermocline were measured as 31%, 66%, and 23% for lakes E-4, S-3, and GTH 91, respectively (Fortino 2010).  The percent organic matter of the hypolimnetic surface sediments (0 – 1 cm) were measured as 45%, 46%, and 24% lakes E-4, S-3, and GTH 91, respectively (Fortino 2010).
Sediment cores were collected from 3 m of water using a K-B style gravity corer. Cores were standardized for incubation by extruding the upper 15 cm of sediment (and overlying water) from each core into a 25 cm long by 4.8 cm i.d. plastic incubation core. The incubation cores were sealed with acrylic or polycarbonate tops and bottoms. The core tops were beveled toward a center opening to exclude all air from the core when sealed. A magnetic stir bar was suspended approximately 1 cm above the sediment–water interface in each core. During incubation, the cores were arranged around a central array of magnets turning at 1 rpm, which slowly turned the stir bars within the cores and prevented stratification of the overlying water. The cores were incubated in a 750 L temperature controlled (± 1o C) water bath. Sampling was performed via two septum–sealed ports fitted to the core top. One port was oriented vertically and allowed for the insertion of a cannula into the overlying water of the core. The other port was arranged perpendicular to the first and permitted the simultaneous replacement of water removed during sampling. The replacement water was collected from the lake at the same time and depth as the cores with a Van Dorn sampler. Between sampling events, the replacement water was stored in a 4–L plastic bottle in the same incubator as the cores. 
The cores were allowed to acclimate approximately 1 h prior to the initial oxygen sampling. During sampling, 4 ml of overlying water was slowly removed from the core through the vertical port using a stainless steel cannula attached to a plastic syringe. The syringe was purged with 1 ml of the sample and the remaining volume was used to determine the oxygen concentration by Winkler titration (Carpenter 1965) modified for the small volume. Plastic stops were designed to fit onto the syringe plunger to ensure that a repeatable volume was retained in the syringe following each purge. The exact volume of sample retained in each syringe following purging was determined gravimetrically. Titrations were conducted immediately following sampling to minimize storage artifacts. 
We assessed the impact of temperature on the magnitude of SOD by incubating replicate cores from each lake at 4 different temperatures representing a realistic range of temperatures experienced by the sediments during the arctic summer (2-17o C).  Lake GTH 91 had 10 replicate cores at each temperature, lake S-3 had 9 replicate cores at each temperature, and lake E-4 had 9 replicate cores for the 2o and 12o C treatments and 8 replicate cores for the 7o and 17o C treatments. All cores were incubated in the dark and the oxygen concentration of the overlying water in the cores was sampled three times over approximately 24 h.  
We measured the effect of oxygen availability on SOD by using the reduction in the oxygen concentration of the overlying water during an approximately 48 h of dark incubation as a manipulation of oxygen availability.  We then quantified the effect of this reduction in oxygen on SOD. For the sediments from Lakes E–4 and S–3, this was accomplished by extending the incubation time of the cores used in the 12o C treatment of the temperature dependence experiment (n = 9 cores for both lakes). The response of the sediments from Lake GTH 91 was assessed in a separate experiment at 9o C (n = 10 cores). Oxygen measurements were taken at 5 time points over the 48 h period to determine SOD. 
Statistics and Calculations
The relationship between the thermocline depth and Kd was investigated with least square regressions for each year. Differences in Kd and DOC concentration among years were tested with analysis of variance (ANOVA). Dissolved organic carbon, cDOM, and Chl a concentrations were standardized as Z–scores to facilitate direct comparison of the regression slopes (Gotelli and Ellison 2004). Dissolved organic carbon, cDOM, and Chl a concentrations were compared using Pearson's correlations. The collinearity between Kd and Julians day and Kd and lake area was assessed with least square regressions with and without the largest lake in the dataset. The thermocline depth in GTH 91 was predicted using a multiple regression of thermocline depth by Kd, surface area, and Julian day without interaction terms from the survey data. Variables were natural log transformed when appropriate to improve linearity. 
In the temperature dependence experiment, SOD was calculated as the sum of the change in oxygen concentration of the overlying water between the successive time intervals. In the oxygen availability experiment, SOD was calculated for each time interval as the change in oxygen concentration of the overlying water from the preceding time point. All oxygen concentration measurements were corrected for oxygen added via the replacement water. Fluxes were normalized to the surface area of the core and expressed as an hourly rate. 
Two outlying points were removed from the analysis of the oxygen availability experiment due to obviously unrealistic values. The effect of temperature and the source of the sediments (i.e., lake) on SOD was analyzed with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The effect of the oxygen concentration of the overlying water and sediment source on SOD was evaluated using a repeated measures ANCOVA. Analyses were performed in JMP (JMP, Ver. 4.0.4. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 1989-2007) or R (R Development Team). 
Case Study; Lake GTH 91
To evaluate how changes in Kd might affect sediment organic matter mineralization through changes in thermocline depth, we modeled the relevant interactions in Lake GTH 91 under 3 cases: 1. current conditions, 2. warming only, and 3. warming plus increased Kd.   We chose to model these relationships in lake GTH 91 because we had collected SOD, bathymetric, and environmental data on the lake, and thus we could reasonably approximate the stratification dynamics.    Current conditions in lake GTH 91 were estimated from temperature, irradiance and dissolved oxygen measurements collected as described above on 8 dates in 2006 and 5 dates in 2008 (Table 5).  The warming only scenario evaluated a 1o C and a 6o C increase in epilimnetic temperature to approximate the 1.1o  to 6.4o C increase in temperature that is considered “likely” by the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; Gudasz et al. 2010).  
The exact changes to lake transparency that may result from climate change in the Arctic and elsewhere are difficult to predict, however Keller et al. (2008) estimate a 0.5 to 2.3 mg L-1 increase in lake DOC concentration per 1o C temperature increase based on a long–term study of 12 lakes over a relatively large spatial area. To conservatively estimate the changes in lake transparency following “likely” warming we modeled a 0.5 mg L-1 increase in lake DOC concentration per 1o C temperature increase (Keller et al. 2008) to produce a range of possible changes in lake GTH 91 DOC concentrations following 0o, 1o, or 6o C warming.  We then used the used the relationship between DOC concentration and Kd identified in the 2008 survey and a measurement of the DOC concentration of lake GTH 91 in early July 2009 to calculate the Kd values associated with the changes in DOC concentration following 0o, 1o, or 6o C warming. 
To evaluate how changes in transparency and stratification depth would affect the environmental conditions of the lake sediments, we calculated the sediment area above and below the thermocline using the relationship from Livingstone and Imboden (1996): 
M=A-(A(1-□(Z_TD/Z_max ))^∝)
Where:
M = the sediment area above the thermocline (ha).
A = the surface area of the lake (ha).
ZTD = the thermocline depth (m).
Zmax = the maximum depth of the lake (m).
α = a non–dimensional exponent determined graphically from the hypsographic curve.
The hypsographic curve of the lake was generated from a bathymetric map created by combining a lake perimeter measurement determined with a Tremble Geo Explorer with sonar transects collected with a Garmin GPSMAP 180. The lake bottom profile was extrapolated from the sonar measurements using a triangulated irregular network to convert the observed depths into 1 m contour lines in ARC-GIS (ESRI 2006). Surface areas and volumes of each depth interval were calculated using the 1 m contour intervals.
To estimate the sediment area above the thermocline with different Kd values we substituted a linear model of the relationship between thermocline depth, Kd, surface area, and Julian day derived from the lake surveys for thermocline depth (ZTD) in equation 1: 
M=A-(A(1-□((β_(1 ) K_d+β_2 〖A+β〗_(3 ) J+β_(0 ))/Z_max ))^α)

Where:
βn = the slope of the multiple regression model for the nth term.
β0 is the y–intercept of the multiple regression model.
Kd = the light attenuation coefficient (m-1).
J = the Julian day.
This linear model is derived from a multiple regression of the effect of Kd, lake surface area, and the Julian day, without interaction on thermocline depth from the lake surveys.  This model partially violates the assumptions of linear models because the Kd was moderately collinear with lake surface area and Julian day in the surveys (see results), however we elect to include these terms because the collinearity was not severe (see results) and lake surface area (Gorham and Boyce 1989) and time since stratification (i.e., Julian day; Blanton 1973, Wetzel 2001) have been shown to be significant factors affecting thermocline depth in addition to transparency.  The effect of transparency on stratification depth was estimated with the above model using the Kd values calculated from the DOC concentrations estimated in lake GTH 91 under 0o, 1o, or 6o C warming.  The Kd  value from the 6o C warming scenario produced a negative sediment area above the thermocline for the first date of the dataset.  This negative value was assumed to be 0 for the calculations of whole-lake SOD. 
We do not have in-situ measurements of gross SOD from above and below the thermocline of lake GTH 91 during the summers of 2006 and 2008, so we estimated the whole-lake SOD using the relationship between SOD, temperature and oxygen concentration from the incubation experiments.  The whole-lake SOD was calculated as the sum of the SOD above and below the thermocline, which was calculated from an estimated areal SOD rate times the relevant sediment area. The areal SOD above the thermocline was estimated as the median of the SOD measured at 12o C in the temperature dependence experiment. The areal SOD below the thermocline was estimated by adjusting the median areal SOD above the thermocline by the slope of the relationship between temperature and SOD and oxygen concentration and SOD from the temperature and oxygen availability experiments, respectively. The temperature and oxygen conditions above and below the thermocline were estimated from the temperature and oxygen profiles collected repeatedly in GTH 91 during the summers of 2006 and 2008.
To evaluate how the three modeled scenarios would alter whole-lake SOD, we calculated whole-lake SOD using the epilimnetic temperature and sediment areas above and below the thermocline for a 0o, 1o, or 6o C warming with and without a change in DOC and transparency.

Results
Lake Surveys
Light attenuation coefficients (Kd) ranged from 0.21 to 0.97 m-1 across all years and had a mean (± 1 standard deviation) of 0.51 (± 0.2) m-1 (Tables 1 and 2). The mean (± standard deviation) Kd in the lakes sampled in 2008 on Julian day 194 was 0.64 (± 0.18) and was significantly greater than the mean Kd of the 2007 (0.43 ± 0.06) or 2006 (0.45 ± 0.23) sampled on Julian day 219 (F2, 44 = 6.4, p = 0.003). Across all years, Kd was significantly but weakly related to surface area (p = 0.02, R2 = 0.12) but the relationship is skewed by the presence of Lake GTH 68 that has a surface area much greater than any other lake in the survey (Tables 1 and 2).  Removal of Lake GTH 68 from the analysis shows a weaker relationship between Kd and lake surface area (p = 0.06, R2 = 0.08). Thermocline depth ranged 3.5 to 11.5 m across all years (Tables 1 and 2) and was significantly related to Kd (Fig. 3). 
The DOC concentration ranged from 4.2 to 6.0 mg L-1 in the lakes sampled in 2007, which was significantly greater (F1, 27 = 38.6, p < 0.001) and less variable than the range of DOC concentrations (1.3 to 4.2 mg L-1) in the 2008 survey (Tables 1 and 2). Dissolved organic carbon concentration was significantly related to Kd in the 2008 survey (r2 = 0.62, p = 0.0002) but not in the 2007 survey (r2 = 0.17, p = 0.185) (Fig. 4). 
During the 2008 survey, DOC and cDOM concentrations were significantly and highly correlated (r = 0.94, p < 0.0001). Chl a concentrations were also significantly correlated with DOC concentration (r = 0.52, p = 0.031) and cDOM concentration (r = 0.51, p = 0.034). The significant correlations prevent the partitioning of the individual impact of each factor on Kd in a single model. Separate regressions show similar effects of the standardized (Z-score) variables on Kd (Fig. 5). Chromophoric dissolved organic matter concentration explained the most variation in Kd (r2 = 0.78), while Chl a concentration explained the least variation in Kd (r2 = 0.34) and DOC concentration was intermediate (r2 = 0.62) (Fig. 5). Estimating light attenuation due to Chl a concentration alone using a Chl a specific attenuation coefficient of 0.016 m-1 (mg Chl a)-1 (Bannister 1974) produced values varying from 0.006 and 0.034 m-1, which accounted for 1.25 to 4% of observed variation in Kd. 
Sediment Incubations
Sediment oxygen demand ranged between -3.3 and 39.0 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 with a median of 15.1 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 across all sediments and temperatures. The oxygen concentration of the overlying water in the cores during the experiment ranged from 0.20 to 0.33 mmol O2 L-1. Temperature and sediment source (i.e., lake) explained 42% of the variation in SOD and there was significant and positive relationship between SOD and temperature across all three lake sediments (slope ± CI95% = 0.61 ± 0.24 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 per degree C) and no significant interaction between temperature and sediment source (Fig. 6; Table 3). After accounting for the variation due to temperature there remained a significant effect of sediment source on SOD (Table 3). Median SOD across all temperatures was 12.6, 16.88, and 15.7 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 in the sediments from lakes E-4, S-3 and GTH 91, respectively. 
In the oxygen availability experiment, we tested the effect of the oxygen concentration of the overlying water on SOD. The oxygen concentration of the overlying water ranged between 0.1 and 0.3 mmol O2 L-1 and SOD ranged between -7.7 and 39.8 with a median of 11.4 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 (Fig. 7). The highest SOD measurements were similar in magnitude to those from the temperature experiment but the reduction in oxygen in the overlying water reduced SOD at a rate (± CI95%) of 49 ± 21 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 per mmol O2 L-1 to levels below those seen in the temperature dependence experiment (Figs. 6 and 7). 
As with the temperature dependence experiment, there were significant differences in SOD among the sediments collected from the different lakes after accounting for the variation due to oxygen concentration and no interaction between oxygen concentration and sediment source (Table 4). The median SOD across all oxygen concentrations was 10.1, 14.8, and 9.8 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 in the sediments from lakes E-4, S–3 and GTH 91, respectively. 
Case Study; GTH 91
Thermocline depth ranged between 2.0 and 5.5 m when lake GTH 91 was sampled in 2006 and 2008 (Table 5). Over the same time period, Kd ranged from 0.56 to 1.04 m-1.  Regression of the actual thermocline depths against Julian day explained 92% of the variation in the data and showed a 0.09 m d-1 increase in thermocline depth with time (Fig. 8).  The DOC concentration of lake GTH 91 in early July 2009, was 5.5 mg L-1 (SCW, unpub. data), which produces an estimated Kd value of 1.04 m-1.  Estimation of the change in thermocline depth by Julian day using the modeled Kd value shows a 0.07 m d-1 increase in thermocline depth with time and a 40% reduction in the initial thermocline depth (Fig. 8). During the period sampled, the actual percent sediment area above the thermocline estimated from equation 1 varied from 10.6 to 32.9%. Using the Kd of lake GTH 91 estimated from the DOC concentration, the model (eq. 2) estimates that percent sediment area above the thermocline would vary between 6.2 and 23.0% over the same time period as the study. 
The median temperature of the epilimnion of GTH 91 during 2006 and 2008 was 12.9o C.  We estimated the areal SOD of the epilimnion of GTH 91 as 18.6 mmol O2 m-2 d-1, which is the median SOD of the sediments from GTH 91 at 12o C from temperature dependence experiment. The temperature and oxygen profiles collected in GTH 91 show that the water temperature below the thermocline was approximately 4.5o C and the median oxygen deficit was 59% of surface O2 (Table 5). Using these temperature and oxygen conditions, the estimated areal SOD rate below the thermocline declines to 8.2 mmol O2 m-2 d-1. Using these estimates of the SOD above and below the thermocline, the model based on no warming or change in transparency shows a summertime range of whole-lake SOD from 221 to 264 mol O2 d-1 with a median of 247 mol O2 d-1 (Fig. 9).  Assuming a 1o C increase in temperature above the thermocline with no change in thermocline depth, the model shows a 1% increase in median whole-lake SOD (Fig. 9).  Assuming a 6o C increase in temperature above the thermocline with no change in thermocline depth, the model predicts a 5.9% increase in whole-lake SOD (Fig. 9). 
The DOC concentration of lake GTH 91 in early July 2009 was 5.5 mg L-1 (SCW, unpub. data), so a 0.5 mg L-1 increase in lake DOC concentration per 1o C temperature increase would result in a DOC concentration of 6.0 and 8.5 mg L-1 following a 1o and 6o C increase in temperature, respectively.   We estimate that these increases in the DOC concentration would increase the Kd value of the lake to 1.1 and 1.5 m-1, respectively.  Out model predicts that this change in transparency would result in a range of 5 to 22% sediment area above the thermocline for a 1o C temperature increase and a range of 0 to 15% sediment above the thermocline for a 6o C increase in temperature over the same time period as the study.
Based on these results, the net effect of warming and a change in transparency and thermocline depth would be a reduction in the whole-lake SOD due to the reduction in sediment area above the thermocline.  The model output including a change in lake transparency showed a 0.5% reduction in whole lake SOD following a 1o C increase in temperature and a 5% decrease in whole-lake SOD following a 6o C increase in temperature (Fig. 9). 
Discussion
Lake Surveys
The results of the surveys clearly show that lakes with greater light attenuation develop shallower thermoclines, which is consistent with the hypothesis that water clarity is a principal factor controlling thermocline depth in small (< 500 ha) lakes (Fee et al 1996, Mazumder and Taylor 1994, Houser 2006). Light attenuation results from the absorption of photons by dissolved and particulate matter suspended in the lake water (Wetzel 2001). The lakes in the region of this study contain very low levels of suspended particulates (K. Fortino, pers. obs.) and therefore, as in other systems, light attenuation is likely due to dissolved organic matter (DOC and cDOM; Fee et al. 1996, Houser 2006, Caplanne and Laurion 2008). This conclusion is supported by the strong correlations of both DOC and cDOM with Kd in the 2008 survey. Unfortunately, cDOM was not measured in 2007 so the relationship between cDOM and Kd cannot be assessed. Furthermore in 2007, DOC was a poor predictor of Kd and there was less light attenuation per unit of DOC than in the 2008 survey. Assuming that light attenuation is primarily the result of cDOM, these results suggest that there was a decoupling of the bulk DOC concentration from the chromophoric (i.e., light attenuating) component of the DOC in 2007 but not 2008.  We did not collect sufficient data to characterize the dissolved organic matter in the lakes so we cannot test any hypothesizes as to why there was no relationship between the bulk DOC and light attenuation in 2007.  Given the high correlation between DOC, cDOM, and Kd in 2008 and the well established relationship between DOC and light attenuation in oligotrophic lakes (Wetzel 2001), we suspect that the lack of a relationship between DOC and Kd in the 2007 survey was a somewhat isolated phenomenon and not a general pattern for the region.  
In the 2008 survey DOC, cDOM, and Chl a all have a nearly identical relationship with Kd, however the correlations among the factors prevents the statistical partitioning of their individual effects. Unlike in 2007, bulk DOC is highly correlated with Kd and cDOM, and both variables likely reflect allochthonous organic matter (OM) inputs. The relationship between Chl a and Kd is significant but estimation of the light attenuation specific to Chl a shows that the observed Chl a concentrations could only account for a small amount (< 5%) of the measured Kd. Overall, these results strongly suggest that Kd in these lakes is controlled by variation in allochthonous DOM. 
Sediment Incubations
SOD ranged between -7.7 and 39.8 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 with a median of 13.8 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 across all the lakes. This range of measurements is similar to the SOD range of 1.6 to 33 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 reported by Pace and Prairie (2005) in a review of studies using similar methods. As far as we are aware there are no other published measurements of gross SOD from the Alaskan low arctic, yet the range of SOD observed in our study is similar to the range of DIC flux measurements (-0.4 to 42 mmol DIC m-2 d-1, Hobbie et al. 1980), and SOD (32 to 47 mmol O2 m-2 d-1, Ramlal et al. 1994) collected in other shallow arctic systems at higher latitudes. 
Cornwell and Kipphut (1992) measured a net SOD range of 7.1 to 8.1 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 in Toolik Lake (which is on the same landscape as the lakes in our study). These measurements are lower and much less variable than we observed, but represent in situ net SOD collected over 2 to 7 day periods and do not likely reflect the range of environmental conditions found in our study or in the environment. Our measurements of dark SOD across a greater range of environmental conditions and lakes is likely more representative of the actual variation in sediment mineralization in this region of the Arctic. 
The variation in SOD among sediments from within a lake in both the temperature dependence, and oxygen availability experiments greatly exceeded differences in SOD among the three lakes.  This difference in the magnitude of variation suggests that patch–scale variation in temperature and oxygen availability has a greater influence on SOD than landscape–scale differences among lakes (Hobbie et al. 1980, den Heyer and Kalff 1998). Across all of the lakes, variation in SOD was significantly related to variation in temperature and oxygen concentration. SOD increased with temperature regardless of the sediment source and there were no significant differences in the relationship among the different lakes. Pace and Prairie (2005) calculate a mean slope of 0.65 ± 1 for the log–log SOD to temperature relationship in a review of lake SOD experiments. Similar treatment of the present data gives a mean log–log SOD to temperature slope of 0.26 ± 0.08 across all three lakes, which although lower than what was observed by Pace and Prairie (2005), is within the large standard deviation of their collected measurements. This observation indicates that the sediments from the lakes in this study are at the lower end of temperature sensitivity relative to the lakes they report. 
In addition to reduced sensitivity to temperature, we found that SOD increased linearly with temperature across the temperature range tested, whereas previous studies have observed that the response of SOD to temperature is greatest at lower temperatures (< 10o C; Hargrave 1969, Graneli 1978, Pace and Prairie 2005). This difference in response appears to be the result of greater SOD at low temperatures and lower SOD at high temperatures in our study. We measured a median SOD at 2o C across lakes of 12.1 mmol O2 m-2 d-1, whereas the lakes surveyed in Hargrave (1969) do not achieve SOD rates this high until temperatures of approximately 9o C. A similar comparison at higher temperatures shows that the median SOD at 17o C in the sediments from the lakes in our study is 19.7 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 while Hargrave (1969) predicts an SOD of 39 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 at 17o C. This reduced sensitivity of the SOD response to temperature may be due to selection for sediment microbial communities that perform more efficiently at lower temperatures (Madigan et al. 2000) in the persistently cooler temperatures found in arctic lakes. 
SOD is affected by the concentration of oxygen in the water overlying the sediments.  Hargrave (1969) found an approximate reduction of 42 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 per mmol O2 L-1 in Marion Lake, B.C. and Park and Jaffe (1999) calculate an approximate reduction of 63 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 per mmol O2 L-1 using a numerical model of sediment oxygen dynamics. Both of these estimates agree well with the estimated decline of 50 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 per mmol O2 L-1 across the three lakes observed in our study. 
After accounting for the variation in SOD due to temperature and oxygen concentration, we found significant differences in SOD associated with the source of the sediments. The differences among the sediments from the different lakes were small relative to the effects of temperature and oxygen concentration but suggest that other factors may be affecting SOD on a landscape scale. Due to the confounding effects of oxygen concentration and temperature not accounted for in the analysis of the temperature dependence and oxygen availability experiments, respectively, differences in SOD among sediments from the different lakes need to be interpreted cautiously. Nonetheless, among the shallow lakes, the sediments from lake S–3 consistently had higher SOD than those from lake E–4. This may be due to variation in the abundance of benthic algae or sediment metabolism due to variation in sediment substrate quality along a gradient of lake productivity (Sugai and Kipphut 1992, Pace and Prairie 2005). 
Nutrient and chlorophyll data suggest that all of the lakes in this study have similar and low water column productivity (Fortino 2010). Despite this, the organic content of the surface (0-3 cm) sediments of S–3 is greater than E–4 (Fortino 2010) and the sediments from S–3 were more labile than those of E–4 when tested under controlled conditions (Fortino 2010). These results indicate greater quantities and a higher quality of sediment organic matter in lake S–3, relative to lake E–4, which may result in greater SOD in the former. Nonetheless, the differences in SOD due to sediment source were small relative to the effects of temperature and oxygen availability and are not likely to have significant impacts on the variation in SOD over short temporal scales in intact sediments. 
Case Study
The results of the lake surveys indicate the lake transparency is an important factor affecting the thermocline depth in these arctic lakes.  Furthermore, the sediment incubation experiments show that sediment organic matter mineralization rate is affected by the temperature and oxygen concentration of the water overlying the sediments.  The combination of these results suggests that changes in lake transparency may alter whole-lake organic matter mineralization indirectly by changing the distribution of temperature and oxygen in the lake through changes in thermocline depth.  We used Lake GTH 91 as a case study to evaluate how sensitive whole-lake SOD would be to a change in temperature and transparency consistent with possible future climate scenarios. 
The regression model predicting the changes in thermocline depth with time in lake GTH 91 skews the initial thermocline depth shallower and shows a more gradual increase in thermocline depth with time than was observed during the summers of 2006 and 2008. The reduced slope of the modeled thermocline depth with time is likely due to the use of a constant Kd value through time when the observed data shows an overall reduction in the Kd value of the lake with time.  Despite these differences the model produces what appears to be realistic variation in thermocline depth and thus is suitable to assess the sensitivity of whole-lake SOD to changes in thermocline depth. Both the observed and modeled data show that as the thermocline depth increases throughout the summer the sediment area above the thermocline increases.  Since the water above the thermocline was warmer and more oxygenated than the water below the thermocline, thermocline depth is a major factor determining the temperature and oxygen availability of the sediments in both the observed and modeled conditions. 
Gudasz et al. (2010) hypothesize that a predicted 1.8 to 4o C increase in temperature would increase sediment organic matter mineralization rates and decrease sediment organic matter burial efficiency in lakes. Consistent with these findings, the results of the sediment incubations estimate that a 1o and 6o C increase in epilimnetic temperature would increase the SOD (and by inference organic matter mineralization) of the sediments above the thermocline in lake GTH 91 which would result in a 1% to 6% increase in whole lake sediment organic matter mineralization. However this estimate does not consider the effect of changes to thermocline depth that would result from changes in lake transparency. 
Incorporating a decrease in lake transparency into the estimate of sediment respiration in lake GTH 91 following a 1o to 6o C warming shows a 0.5% to 5% decrease in whole–lake SOD despite the increase in SOD above the thermocline.  We recognize that this assessment of the combined effects of temperature and transparency on whole-lake SOD relies on extrapolation from limited data, however the case study shows that whole-lake SOD is sensitive to fairly modest changes in thermocline depth and predicts that the net effect of warming and a decrease in lake transparency is a reduction in the mineralization of sediment organic matter in the lake.

Table 5. Summary of temperature and oxygen profiles from GTH 91 during 2006 and 2008. Thermocline Z is the thermocline depth. Kd is the light extinction coefficient. O2 Deficit is the area-weighted mean oxygen concentration of the epilimnion divided by the area-weighted mean oxygen concentration of the hypolimnion multiplied by 100. Epi. and Hypo. Temp. are the area-weighted mean temperatures of the epilimnion and hypolimnion respectively. Missing data are indicated with a dash (-).

Figure 3. The relationship between thermocline depth and light attenuation coefficient (Kd) in surveys conducted between 2006 and 2008. The line represents the best-fit least squares regression for 2006 (p = 0.001, r2 = 0.55), 2007 (p = 0.04, r2 = 0.36), and 2008 (p = 0.001, r2 = 0.51).
Figure 4. The relationship between the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and light attenuation coefficient (Kd) in the lakes sampled in 2007 and 2008. 
Figure 5. The relationship between the light attenuation coefficient (Kd) and Z-score standardized dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chromophoric dissolved organic matter (cDOM), or natural log transformed chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations in the lakes sampled in 2008. 
Figure 6. The relationship between temperature and sediment oxygen demand (SOD) in each lake. Each point represents the SOD from one core. The dashed line is the least squares regression based on the ANCOVA of temperature and sediment source. 
Figure 7. The effect of bottom water oxygen concentration on sediment oxygen demand (SOD) in sediments from lakes GTH 91, S-3, and E-4. Each point represents SOD from a single core and the dashed lines represent the least squares regression based on the repeated measures ANCOVA of all three lakes. 
Figure 8. Comparison of the actual observed (solid line) relationship between thermocline depth and Julian day in lake GTH 91 and the relationship modeled using Kd values predicted for 0o, 1o, and 6o C warming scenarios.   The lines represent best fit least squared regressions.
Figure 9. Comparison of modeled whole-lake SOD (mol O2 d-1) following 0o, 1o, and 6o C climate warming in lake GTH 91 with warming only (open boxes) and warming plus a reduction in lake transparency (grey boxes).  The boxes represent the upper and lower quartiles and the whiskers indicate the maximum and minimum data values.  The median is shown by the horizontal bar within the box.
